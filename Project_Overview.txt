# Collaborative AI Team Project

## Overview
This project simulates a collaborative AI team consisting of a Team Leader and specialized agents for front-end, back-end, database, testing, and optimization. The Team Leader manages the project end-to-end, breaking it into tasks, assigning them to agents, and ensuring smooth communication and integration.

## File Structure
- **agents/**: Contains agent modules specialized in different aspects of development.
- **project_management/**: Contains the Team Leader who manages the project.
- **tasks/**: Manages task assignment and dependencies.
- **logs/**: Stores project logs.
- **utils/**: Utility functions and communication tools.
- **tests/**: Test cases for verification of each component.
- **main.py**: Entry point for project execution.

## How to Run
1. Install necessary dependencies.
2. Run the project using `python main.py`.

    requirements = "A web application project requiring front-end, back-end, database, testing, and optimization."
    
    # Start the project analysis and task execution
    team_leader.analyze_project(requirements)
    
    # Save the log after completion
    team_leader.save_log_to_file()

    print("\nProject execution complete. Check the logs/project_log.txt file for details.")
